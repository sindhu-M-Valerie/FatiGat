# GitHub API Rate Limit Solution

## Overview
This document explains how FatiGat handles GitHub API rate limits and provides solutions for users.

## What are GitHub API Rate Limits?
GitHub limits the number of API requests from unauthenticated users to 60 requests per hour per IP address. When this limit is exceeded, the API returns a 403 status code.

## FatiGat's Solution

### 1. Automatic Rate Limit Detection
- Checks remaining rate limit before making requests
- Detects rate limit errors from API responses
- Shows clear error messages with reset time

### 2. Intelligent Caching
- Caches user data for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- Reuses cached data when available
- Reduces likelihood of hitting rate limits

### 3. Demo Mode Fallback
When rate limits are hit, FatiGat automatically:
- Switches to demo mode with simulated data
- Shows a clear banner indicating demo mode
- Provides realistic sample repositories and statistics

### 4. Demo Usernames
Special usernames that always show demo data:
- `demo-user`
- `test-dev` 
- `sample-coder`

These bypass the GitHub API entirely and are perfect for testing.

## User Solutions

### For Rate Limit Errors:
1. **Wait**: Rate limits reset every hour
2. **Use Demo Mode**: Try usernames like `demo-user`
3. **Clear Cache**: Refresh the page to clear old data
4. **Try Later**: Come back when the rate limit resets

### Best Practices:
- Don't rapidly switch between many different users
- Use the demo usernames for testing
- Cache will help reduce API calls for recently viewed users

## Rate Limit Information
- **Limit**: 60 requests per hour (unauthenticated)
- **Reset**: Every hour on the hour
- **Check Status**: The app shows when rate limits will reset

## Future Improvements
- GitHub OAuth integration for higher rate limits (5000/hour)
- More sophisticated caching strategies
- Offline mode with stored demo data
